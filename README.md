# Parallel Matrix Multiplication (MPI)
>  A demonstration of parallel computing in C using the [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org) library. This program multiplies a set of two-dimensional arrays using a manager-worker paradigm. With this approach a dataset is distributed among available worker processes which are coordinated by a manager process (a form of data parallelism). 

## Prerequisites
This project requires the Open MPI library.

- [Build from source](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building#easy-build)
- [Install using Homebrew on macOS](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/open-mpi)
- [Install using Windows binaries](https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.6/ms-windows.php)

## Compilation
```bash
mpicc main.c -o parallel
```
## Execution
```bash
mpirun parallel
```
