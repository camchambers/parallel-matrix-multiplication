# Parallel Matrix Multiplication (MPI)
>  A demonstration of parallel computing in C using the [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org) library. This program multiplies a set of two-dimensional arrays using a manager-worker paradigm. With this approach a dataset is distributed among available worker processes which are coordinated by a manager process (a form of data parallelism).
